# Add validations to two models to enforce the following business rules:
# Employees must always have a first name present
# Employees must always have a last name present
# Employees have a hourly_rate that is a number (integer) between 40 and 200
# Employees must always have a store that they belong to (can't have an employee that is not assigned a store)
